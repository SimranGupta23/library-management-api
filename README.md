# Library Management API

A **Node.js** based RESTful API for managing books, users, and book borrowing in a library system. This project uses **MongoDB** for data storage and **JWT** for securing API endpoints. Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt**.

## Features

- **Books Management**: Add, update, view, and delete books.
- **Users Management**: Register, view, update, and delete users.
- **Borrowing System**: Borrow and return books with user and book details.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for securing specific endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Implemented for the books and users listing endpoints.
- **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB for data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework to build the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library to interact with MongoDB.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Token-based authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For hashing passwords.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud-based instance.
